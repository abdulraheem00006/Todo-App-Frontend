// So this server.js acts as an api
// Now I have a value.json file which has an object with an array inclosed in the object.
// The array contains hard coded objects but I want to update that json file dynamically.

/* First lets start with the simple task of sending data to the postman, so that the hard coded
 objects are visible there. */

/* Now I'll try to import Values.json file that is stored in the backend folder to this file  
 and then send that hardcoded object to the postman */
// import data from "./Values.json";

const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = 4000;
const data = require("./Values.json");

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send(JSON.stringify(data.data));
});

// app.get("/", (req, res) => {
//   res.send("Hello World");
// });

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listens on port ${port}`);
});

// Hello world is visble on the browser and also in the postman app
